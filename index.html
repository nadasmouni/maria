				I started showing interest for fashion world since I was a kid. First , I used to draw fashion croquis on paper , then I told myself it would be better to draw them on a special software , so that way I also developped my skills in digital drawing. After enrolling the GBBA program  , I started taking online courses about the fundamuntals of fashion and graphic design.
